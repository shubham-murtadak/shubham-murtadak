## ***Hi there! I'm Shubham <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwMDyS6rv3sB8yI/giphy.gif" width=50 height=50>***

I’m an **AI/ML Engineer & Researcher** who builds **end-to-end AI systems** — from data to deployed product.

I love taking ideas from **research → prototype → production**, and most of my work is **practical, code-first, and result-driven**.  
From **classical ML to Deep Learning, LLMs, RAG, Agentic AI, and scalable deployments**, I work across the entire stack to ship **real products**, not demos.

### 🔥 What I Work On
🧠 **AI Agents** — single/multi-agent, MCP, browser, voice & automation agents  
🗂️ **RAG systems** — hybrid search, agentic RAG, document graph RAG, local RAG  
🧩 **LLMs** — fine-tuning, distillation, prompt engineering, structured reasoning  
📊 **Machine Learning** — classification, forecasting, recommendation, anomaly detection  
🤖 **Deep Learning** — vision, NLP, transformers, multimodal systems  
📉 **Data Science & MLOps** — feature engineering, pipelines, CI/CD for ML, model lifecycle  
📦 **Deployments** — AWS / GCP / Azure, inference optimization, containers, vector DBs  
⚙️ **Production AI apps** — scalable backends, observability, evals, monitoring

### 💡 About Me
🎯 I work in **AI/ML research and product development** — solving real business problems with high-impact automation & intelligent systems.

🔍 Core themes of my work:
- AI agents with reliable autonomy & tool use  
- Structured reasoning + planning + memory  
- Efficient RAG pipelines that actually work at enterprise scale  
- ML + LLM coupling for real-world automation  
- Local + cloud AI stacks for cost-efficient deployment  

💪 Philosophy: **AI should ship, scale, and solve real problems — not stay a lab experiment.**

### 🚀 What I’m Building Next
- Smarter agents that can **plan, observe, learn, and retry**  
- **Mixed AI stacks** → LLMs + classical ML + knowledge graphs  
- **Low-cost reliable deployments** using open-source LLMs  
- **Frameworks + templates** that help devs skip noise & build faster

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
If you're working on **AI Agents, RAG, AI/ML research or product development**, I'm always open to meaningful conversations & collaboration.
